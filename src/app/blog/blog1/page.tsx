            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              Traditional classroom instruction follows a uniform pace that doesn't account for individual learning differences. Research has shown that students receiving one-on-one tutoring perform significantly better than those in conventional classrooms.
            </p>

            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              AI-powered adaptive learning systems address this by continuously analyzing student performance, identifying knowledge gaps, and adjusting content difficulty in real-time.

            <p>
              Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) combine cognitive psychology, artificial intelligence, and educational theory to provide individualized instruction. These systems model three key components:
            </p>
            <ol className="space-y-2 ml-6">
              <li><strong>Domain Model:</strong> Knowledge representation of the subject matter</li>
              <li><strong>Student Model:</strong> Dynamic assessment of learner's current understanding</li>
              <li><strong>Pedagogical Model:</strong> Teaching strategies and intervention techniques</li>
            </ol>
