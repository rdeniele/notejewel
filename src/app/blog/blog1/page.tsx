          Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly changing the landscape of education. From personalized learning platforms to intelligent tutoring systems, AI is helping students learn more efficiently and effectively.
        </p>
        <h2>Personalized Learning</h2>
        <p>
          AI-powered tools can adapt to each student's strengths and weaknesses, providing customized content and feedback. For example, platforms like <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Khan Academy</a> and <a href="https://www.coursera.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coursera</a> use AI to recommend lessons and exercises tailored to individual progress.
        </p>
        <h2>Intelligent Tutoring</h2>
        <p>
          Intelligent tutoring systems, such as <a href="https://www.carnegielearning.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carnegie Learning</a>, leverage AI to provide real-time hints and explanations, helping students master complex concepts at their own pace.
        </p>
        <h2>Research and Evidence</h2>
        <p>
          Studies show that AI-driven adaptive learning can improve student outcomes. For example, a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131520301130" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 study in Computers & Education</a> found that adaptive systems increased engagement and achievement in mathematics.
        </p>
        <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
        <p>
          As AI continues to evolve, students will have access to even more powerful tools for learning, collaboration, and creativity. Embracing these technologies can help learners of all backgrounds reach their full potential.
